I am going back to the basics with this question, but could someone throw some light on how the "++" operator works? I was trying to figure out the rules by this dummy code I made (have added the outputs I received), but I can't seem to understand the exact logic that implies and keep messing up with the solutions.

NOTE: For the sake of simplicity, I reset the value n = 3 after each line.
